This notebook is aimed to analyze a company’s ideal customers. By exploring the dataset at hand, I will use plotting and clustering to better understand these customers and finally suggest ways to improve their business by modifying products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
